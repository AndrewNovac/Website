Hi there! Nice of you to take the time to get to know me, it's always a pleasure when worlds collide.

I'm an open book, mostly because of my love for reading. I've zoned in on fantasy books at the moment, and I usually finish them in between Windows updates. My favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson, Steven Erikson, and Terry Pratchett.

I also like to take on fun projects that I can use in my everyday life. Almost everthing I work on is published on my github! Incomplete or in progress repos are set to private, but one day they might see the light of day. A recurring theme you'll find is the integration of music in my programs, and if you'd like to preview some of my playlists, check out my [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/omnitenebris)!

Finally, if we follow the pigeon-hole theory, then we'll find that there is no option to be anyone other than yourself, since everyone else is taken. In truth, if you take everything I've said in this about me and place it [here](https://libraryofbabel.info/search.html), you'll see how unique my words are!
