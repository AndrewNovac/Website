I spend most of my free time on two major activites. One is coding, I like to take on fun projects that I can use in my everyday life. Almost everthing I work on is published on my github! Incomplete or in progress repos are set to private, but one day they might see the light of day.

The rest of my time is spent reading books! Exciting isn't it? I've been reading ever since I could go into a library on my own, and I usually finish them in between Windows updates. My favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson, Steven Erikson, and Terry Pratchett. A lot of other numerous authors could be mentioned here, but I'd be suprised if you got this far anyway.

If we follow the pigeon-hole theory, then we'll find that there is no option to be anyone other than yourself, since everyone else is taken. In truth, if you take everything I've said in this about me and place it [here](https://libraryofbabel.info/search.html), you'll see how unique my words are!

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me! It's useful to go out of this world and see it from the perspective of another one, so I hope to get to see your world soon.
