									<h1>An Introduction</h1>
									<p> “Life before death, strength before weakness,
									journey before destination.” - Brandon Sanderson</p>

								<h2>Pathfinder</h2>
								<p>I'm right there in the center of the above picture, under the well placed quote by Brandon Sanderson, aimed to show you how special I am. Personally, I never thought I'd be on this path, having had an initially very Economic/Commerce focused start. Since then, I attempted to go into Mathematics and Statistics in an effort to enter a more logical path. Instead, I went through freshman year rooming with a Computer Science student who helped me discover the fun a challenging program can give. In a world of technology, the ability to create any object your heart desires with lines of code is what appeals to me the most. Since then, I've been taking on more challenging logical classes in order to improve myself.</p>
								<p>Fun fact, if you copy and paste the above quote onto this <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/search.html">library</a>, you'll see how unique I am!</p>
								<h2>Wanderer</h2>
								<p>I spend most of my free time on two major activites. One is coding, I like to take on big projects and learn along the way, which expands my knowledge and the final product is usually applicable and usable! I have two favorite products I've had the pleasure of working on, one was the ERA application, which allowed Android users to get medical attention efficiently and I hope to expand it soon. The other is a music exploration web application, which I created after a short time working as a music curator. I took my knowledge of that and some machine learning (recommendation algorithms mostly) to create a way for users to explore music in their own bubble. I hope to expand this and work on an exploration feature for movies, books, and more!</p>
								<p>The rest of my time is spent reading books! Exciting isn't it? I've been reading ever since I could go into a library on my own, and I've been finishing them faster than a new version of anything by Microsoft needing to be patched. My favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson (who takes a break from writing by writing another book), Steven Erikson (the archaeologist gone author), and Terry Pratchett (who has gone for the long walk across the desert). A lot of other numerous authors could be mentioned here, but I'd be suprised if you got this far anyway.</p>
								<p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me! It's useful to go out of this world and see it from the perspective of another one, so I hope to get to see your world soon.</p>
